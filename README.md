# Chewbyte

Chewbyte is intended to be a library (with a somewhat feature-complete CLI) for transforming config files into other formats. It supports not only formats like JSON and YAML but also dynamic ones like Jsonnet.

Jsonnet support will be the most actively maintained one.

Currently this software is in very-alpha-not-intended-for-production-use state, but hopefully this is subject to change soon.
